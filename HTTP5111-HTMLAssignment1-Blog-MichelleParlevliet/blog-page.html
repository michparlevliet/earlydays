        <h2>The Creative Process for Lazy People</h2>
        <img src="img/article1.jpg" alt="Portrait of a man's torso">
        <p>
          No matter how unorganized, unorthodox, or unprofessional you might feel when you start a project, everyone has a creative process that guides them to their result. While some are certainly more efficient than others, every method serves a purpose to its creator. 
        </p>
        <p>
          That being said, one’s creative process can be improved with a little TLC. The first step is to break down what’s happening in your creative process. It’s not just about how you get from and idea to the finished product, what happens before the idea is important to understand as well. The brainstorming phase is one of the most important parts of the process. Without it, the creative process won’t have much luck starting over again, except in random spur-of-the-moment moods where creativity feels easy. How you approach the ideating portion of creating will entirely change your consistency. For example, if I were to examine my own first step in my creative process, I would see that areas needing improvement would be patience, note-taking, and prototyping. Ideas come and go through my mind on a daily basis, but not often are they really considered or taken note of – even if they’re really good! My brainstorming process could benefit from writing down my ideas more thoroughly when I get them, or even sitting down and trying to write them down before they even come. This way, they’d live on paper instead of in my mind, which tends to think it will remember every good idea but never seems to be able to. In addition, making time to sit and think or sketch rough ideas out is as useful as making time to actually complete a project. It is the beginning of a practicing artist, not just one who can make amazing things but doesn’t.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next important aspect to examine about your creative process is the planning phase. How am I gonna take this idea from brain matter to a tactile product? Planning can look a lot different depending on the craft, the creator, and the amount of time devoted to the project. The most important thing is that there is an element of planning involved. Many people think that because art comes from the soul and is bred by passion it doesn’t need to be or even shouldn’t be planned out. Sure, there may be a place or time where improvisation would serve a piece. But even improv requires a plan of some kind. Going into something blind is almost impossible, as humans are wired to think ahead. So, since you’re going to be thinking about it anyways, you may as well go the extra mile and make the process easier for yourself by drawing out some mockups, testing out the look in a digital setting, or even just taking your time when picking a color palette.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you’re ready to start, it’s a good idea to book yourself time to complete certain aspects of the project instead of tackling them all at once. Dividing the work up can not only make it seem less daunting, it can also help you spend more careful time on each aspect and avoid skipping any bits that you might not love to do. This might be painful at first, but over time it makes you a well-balanced artist.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout the working period, taking breaks from a large project can be revitalizing to the creative mindset. Time away from a work can help you get out of those little ruts that can make you lose faith in a project, however, you may come back to a project sometimes to find it looking even worse than you remember it. Because of this fatal flaw that affects most creators, try to be mindful when returning to or even leaving your work before a break. Taking down some notes about what you’re liking, what you’re not, what you’re feeling excited about can all be beneficial to getting through ruts.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the project starts nearing the end, it can be hard not to race to the finish without the same quality you kept in mind for the majority of the work. Being done is typically a really great feeling, but don’t mistake the brief relief of being finished for the genuine feeling of being proud of the work you created. The last leg is your chance to make the final touches that divide a decent project between and amazing one. Basically, don’t cheap out on the last few hours spent, when you know you could get away with a project that looks great to others, but compared to your original idea seems to fall a bit flat. Always put in the last 110%, because that’s the bit that will truly make the biggest difference on each individual project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, never be afraid to go back and rework the project. Nothing is perfect, and there’s always room for improvement. At the same time, it’s okay to be done with a project. Move on, do things differently, grow. Come back later or don’t come back at all. It’s all a part of the process.
